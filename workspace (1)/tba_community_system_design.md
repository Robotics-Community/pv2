## Implementation approach
The semi-functioning prototype will be built using React, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. The backend will use Node.js with Express for API development and MongoDB for database management. These technologies are chosen for their scalability, ease of use, and community support. The prototype will focus on P0 requirements: multi-program support, team pages, media uploads, and a dynamic feed.

## Data structures and interfaces
classDiagram
    class User {
        +userId: String
        +name: String
        +email: String
        +password: String
        +role: String
        +createUser()
        +authenticate()
    }

    class Team {
        +teamId: String
        +name: String
        +bio: String
        +logo: String
        +members: List[User]
        +createTeam()
        +updateTeam()
    }

    class Post {
        +postId: String
        +author: User
        +team: Team
        +media: List[String]
        +tags: List[String]
        +createPost()
        +updatePost()
        +deletePost()
    }

    class Feed {
        +feedId: String
        +posts: List[Post]
        +filterPosts()
        +getFeed()
    }

    User --> Team : "can belong to"
    Team --> Post : "can create"
    Post --> Feed : "is part of"

## Program call flow
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant T as Team
    participant P as Post
    participant F as Feed
    U->>T: createTeam()
    T-->>U: Team created
    U->>P: createPost()
    P-->>U: Post created
    U->>F: getFeed()
    F-->>U: Return filtered posts

## Anything UNCLEAR
1. What specific APIs should be integrated for real-time updates?
2. How will the leaderboard system be endorsed by robotics programs?
3. What criteria will be used for gamified engagement metrics?
